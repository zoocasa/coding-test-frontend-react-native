# Instructions

Format: a 45 min pair programming session followed by 15 minutes of discussion and feedback.

Goal: We're going to be creating a simple app in React Native app based on a spec.

Preparation: Candidate should have a React Native development environment up and running on their local machine including NodeJS v16 or higher and yarn package manager.

Notes & Tips: We're simulating a regular work day so the candidate is allowed to Google anything during the test (we don't expect you to have syntax memorized). The most successful candidates share their thoughts as they work, what ideas they have and what they're trying to do.
